              While I haven't yet coded an entire full-fledged application from scratch using React, I've made valuable contributions by making small but significant modifications to existing apps. These modifications have allowed me to gain practical experience with React and understand its core principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working on existing apps has given me the opportunity to grasp the intricacies of React's component-based architecture, state management, and its ecosystem of libraries and tools. It has also enabled me to appreciate the importance of maintaining and enhancing existing codebases, which is a vital skill in development.

            My journey into becoming a full stack web developer has been marked by hands-on experience and a constant drive to learn. My professional path has equipped me with valuable skills and insights in web development, particularly during my time at the Hospital General de Granollers (HGG) and a meat factory.
            <br>
            During my internship at HGG, I was immersed in the world of web development. Working closely with the hospital's IT team, I had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of web applications tailored for the healthcare environment. This experience exposed me to the intricacies of developing applications that meet the specific needs of a hospital, from appointment scheduling systems to data management tools. The exposure to real-world healthcare applications significantly broadened my expertise in web development.
            <br>
            Subsequently, my role at a meat factory as a web developer and data analyst allowed me to apply my web development skills in a corporate setting. One of my notable achievements in this position was the development of a web application designed to assess cost-to-expense ratios for various sections of the company. This application streamlined the decision-making process and provided critical insights for improving efficiency and profitability. Additionally, I worked extensively with Excel, extracting and manipulating data from databases, and automating queries using Power Query. This experience reinforced my proficiency in data analysis and automation.
            <br>
            Through these roles, I honed my full stack web development skills, gained valuable insights into web applications' practical applications, and developed a strong foundation in data analysis. I am eager to continue leveraging my expertise to create innovative web solutions and automate tasks for future endeavors.

            <br>
            Beyond my professional roles, coding is not just a job for me; it's a genuine passion that I pursue in my free time. I find immense satisfaction in crafting software solutions, especially in the realm of automation and personal projects.
            <br>
            One of my favorite coding pastimes is enhancing my Linux installation through automation scripts. I enjoy tailoring my operating system to my exact needs and preferences. Whether it's optimizing system tasks, simplifying software installations, or customizing my desktop environment, I find joy in crafting automation code that enhances my Linux experience.
            <br>
            For the sheer love of coding, I embarked on a personal project to create a JavaScript framework, akin to jQuery, simply for the fun and challenge of it. This endeavor allowed me to explore the intricacies of web development further and develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript's capabilities. It was a testament to my enthusiasm for technology and my continuous desire to learn and grow as a developer.
            <br>
            One of my most rewarding personal achievements was automating a classic role-playing game similar to Dungeons and Dragons, called Anima: Beyond Fantasy. This undertaking required a combination of coding skills, creativity, and a deep understanding of game mechanics. I developed scripts and tools that streamlined gameplay, automated character management, and made the overall gaming experience more immersive and enjoyable for my group. This project not only demonstrated my technical prowess but also showcased my ability to apply coding to areas outside of traditional web development

            <h2>Cost expense app</h2>
            I developed a cost expenses ratio web application for efficient financial analysis, using Svelte for the frontend and Pocketbase for the backend. Svelte's reactivity and component-based structure created a user-friendly interface, while Pocketbase ensured secure data storage and real-time updates.
            To enhance data management, I integrated automated Excel processes, allowing users to export and import data seamlessly. This project demonstrates my ability to choose the right tools for practical solutions and automate processes, optimizing financial analysis in a corporate environment.
            <h2>Jquery-like framework</h2>
            I undertook the exciting challenge of creating a custom JavaScript framework akin to jQuery, but with a twist—this framework was entirely built using TypeScript. My objective was to provide a powerful and versatile tool for web development, allowing developers to simplify and enhance the creation of web pages.
            This framework not only encapsulates the fundamental features commonly associated with jQuery, such as DOM manipulation and event handling, but also embraces the type safety and enhanced code organization offered by TypeScript. By harnessing TypeScript's static typing and object-oriented capabilities, I aimed to streamline the development process and reduce potential errors in web projects.
            The remarkable part of this endeavor is that the very webpage you are currently viewing was built using the framework I created. It's a testament to the practicality and efficiency of the framework, enabling rapid development of interactive and responsive web pages.
